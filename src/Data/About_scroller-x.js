And there is a great deal of evidence that the modern sport of stand up paddle boarding (SUP),which is immensely popular worldwide, also originated here — started by the beach boys at Waikiki decades ago, revived more recently by big wave surfers on Maui, then introduced to the rest of the world."

You can pretty it up, paint pictures on it, make it a work of art, write a message on it, then mail it. Just make sure it’s an older dried-out unhusked coconut (pictured) or you might need an agricultural inspection before mailing. Various stores, and some hotels and restaurants, sell coconuts that are already decorated and ready for mailing. (This coconut postcard display was shot at the gift shop at Maui Ocean Center.) So why send a postcard? Mail a coconut! (Mailing cost is approximately $12-$20, depending on the weight of the coconut)."

If measured from the sea floor, Haleakala would rise to a height of nearly 30,000 feet. This massive volcano, which formed 75% of the island of Maui, is dormant . . . NOT extinct. The last eruption of Haleakala is estimated to have occurred in the late 1700s."

Anything goes. Since the weather is warm year-round, we wear the same wardrobe for summer and winter. We don’t dress seasonally."

The famed architect originally conceived this design in 1949 as a private home (on a smaller scale), and at one point the design was intended as a home for Marilyn Monroe. Read more here on how it came to be on Maui. This is a private golf club, but guests are welcome to visit the spectacular clubhouse and enjoy the fabulous view! If you’d like to play a round of golf at this exclusive course, you can purchase a Guest-For-A-Day pass–available on a limited basis. (UPDATE: Due to COVID, the clubhouse is temporarily closed to the public and the course is open only for Members’ play.) "
