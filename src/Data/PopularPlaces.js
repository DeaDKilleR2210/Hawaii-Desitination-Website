Instead of bringing the natural beauties of the island indoors, this restaurant has created an atmosphere that echoes the architecture of ancient Italy. With granite floors and brick walls, the interior has a warm and stately grandeur. The fixed menu changes frequently, driven by what is in season. Guests are offered two options upon arriving: the chef’s recommendation, or a vegetable selection that caters to alternative preferences and needs.

At Alan Wong’s Honolulu, guests are met with friendly staff that are passionate about sharing local flavors and ingredients. The restaurant creates an atmosphere that embraces both the fine-dining nature of the food, and the laid-back nature of the islands. Plating at Alan Wong’s is artful, and dishes are served looking nearly too good to eat. Don’t leave without trying ‘The Coconut’: a chocolate shell, filled with sorbet and topped with tropical fruits – looking just like a halved coconut.",

Some of the most popular dishes include the opakapaka, a local crimson snapper crusted in mochi and lightly fried, and the pork chop: glazed with kimchi, and so tender that it falls off the bone. Dessert is equally important and well thought out, including the MW candy bar: a crunchy macadamia praline with salted caramel, chocolate, and cookie. The decor inside MW Honolulu is simple and clean, with high ceilings, large windows, and light colors. The atmosphere is upscale, yet still exudes a casual vibe that makes guests feel welcomed and comfortable.",

Pillowy gnocchi is served with octopus bolognese and crispy potato skins. Ricotta pancakes are served with strawberries and Thai basil.
